<!-- Requirements
Use semantic HTML and CSS to create your website. Use your creativity to design and develop your vision for this website.
There should be at least three buttons on your website, which represent different categories of items you can buy at the supermarket
(for example, a button for cereal, meats, juices).
When a category is clicked, your page should populate with at least five images of items related to that category
(for example, clicking on the cereal button will show five different types of cereal).
When I click on a specific shopping item, the item should be added to my shopping cart. The shopping list will show all of the items that
the user has currently selected.
Keep your code DRY. -->
